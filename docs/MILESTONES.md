# MILESTONES — implementation history

Chronological log of how the audit-first harness was built, milestone by milestone. This is the
**history**; the **stable design** lives in [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) (section
references below point there). Short commit hashes are given for traceability, not as an exhaustive
git history.

Versioning shorthand: **v0.1** = the audit & measurement spine; **v0.2** = the offline formal
gate/pipeline engineering; **v0.3** = the structured-judge source-fidelity evidence pipeline. The
closed-loop controller (ARCHITECTURE §12, §20.1) remains future research.

---

## v0.1 — audit & measurement spine

- **Initial harness** (`7cc9451`). Source cards (`docs/theorem_index.yaml`), the formal-mapping
  bridge (`docs/formal_mapping.yaml`), fidelity reviews + the human-approval *input* gate, blinded
  hash-provenanced mutation packages (`run_mutants.py --dry-run`), the opt-in live judge runner
  (`run_judge.py --execute-api`) + manual import, judge scoring (`score_judge.py`), the textual
  no-sorry check (`check_sorries.py`), Comparator triples with a real run on **PutCallParity**, and
  generated pipeline/validation/mutation reports.
- **First-steps docs** (`d453187`) — spelled out the `source.tex → theorem-card` path for new
  targets.
- **Judge-parsing hardening** (`a494c27`) — malformed-output reporting, verdict recovery, and
  parse-format metrics (ARCHITECTURE §9, §10.2).
- **ARCHITECTURE.md added** (`9ebe5db`) — the design document.

## v0.2 — offline formal gate & pipeline

- **Repo cleanup** before the gate work (`ea6e0d5`).
- **Offline promotion gate** (`e9e2d8c`) — `scripts/gate_decision.py`, a pure offline
  `PROMOTE / BLOCK / REVISE / HUMAN_REVIEW` decision (ARCHITECTURE §11).
- **Target-scoped pipeline runs** (`fe6f887`) — `rebuild_pipeline.py --target` (ARCHITECTURE §20.2).
- **Comparator-status writeback** (`f19ce73`) — explicit `comparator_status` into
  `formal_mapping.yaml`, with an honest sandbox-status vocabulary (ARCHITECTURE §13.4).
- **Kernel axiom audit** (`dbef69e`) — `check_axioms.py`, `#print axioms` ⊆ permitted set, no
  `sorryAx` (ARCHITECTURE §14).
- **Guarded provable-equivalence path** (`33a02fe`) — `PASS_PROVABLE_EQUIV` requires a *built*
  in-Lean equivalence lemma; `check_equivalence.py` (ARCHITECTURE §20.6).
- **TwoAssetMinVar worked target** (`1330531`) — the second worked target (ARCHITECTURE §19).
- **Lean theorem/helper module refactor** (`bf1a8c0`) — short source-facing theorem modules +
  `Helpers.lean` proof-engineering modules (ARCHITECTURE §5.1).
- **GoldIrrationalSqrtTwo reference target** (`092bbd0`) — a public gold-reference fixture wrapping
  Mathlib's `irrational_sqrt_two` (ARCHITECTURE §19.1).

## v0.3 — structured-judge evidence pipeline

- **1a — structured judge schema validator** (`7dae994`) — `validate_judge_schema.py`; the
  `schema_version: "0.3.0"` record and its `VALID / PARTIAL_RECOVERED / INVALID` classification
  (ARCHITECTURE §9.1).
- **1b — structured judge scoring** (`874a787`) — `score_judge.py --structured`; reliability metrics
  over the real/mutant answer key, schema validity reported separately (ARCHITECTURE §10.3).
- **1c — conservative judge-metric gate caps** (`64f1ab1`) — `gate_decision.py --judge-metrics`;
  structured metrics may only cap an otherwise-promotable target to `HUMAN_REVIEW`, never BLOCK or
  PROMOTE (ARCHITECTURE §11.5).
- **2a — structured judge-output export** (`32c5e71`) — `export_structured_judge_results.py`;
  un-blinds blinded judge results via the answer key into validated structured JSON, on the scoring
  side of the blinding boundary (ARCHITECTURE §10.4).
- **2b — offline structured-judge workflow runner** (`ba34aaf`) —
  `run_structured_judge_workflow.py`; chains export → validate → score → (optional) gate over
  existing judge results, offline and deterministic, separate from the formal pipeline
  (ARCHITECTURE §10.5).

## Documentation & recorded evidence

- **Documentation split** (`90ae0b5`) — separated the stable design (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) from this
  chronological log (`MILESTONES.md`); updated the stale "v0.1 experimental" wording to reflect the
  implemented v0.2/v0.3 layers; closed-loop controller still marked future.
- **Architecture gap analysis** (`8ecb2b9`) — added `docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md`, an audit snapshot of
  what is implemented / partial / future, with a ranked next-step roadmap and acceptance criteria.
- **Recorded Comparator passes for all targets** (`ce5d8f3`) — ran the real Comparator with
  `--writeback-comparator-status` for **PutCallParity**, **TwoAssetMinVar**, and
  **GoldIrrationalSqrtTwo**; all three now record `comparator_status: PASSED_REAL_LANDRUN_BEST_EFFORT`
  (previously `NOT_RUN`). This is **formal Challenge/Solution Comparator evidence only** (kernel
  acceptance of statement equality under a bounded axiom set) — **not** source-`.tex` fidelity
  evidence. The status is conservative: `BEST_EFFORT` because `landrun` runs `--best-effort` and the
  Landlock ABI was not asserted ≥ 5 (ARCHITECTURE §13.4).
- **Structured pipeline status + gate freshness check** — `rebuild_pipeline.py --pipeline-status-out`
  emits a machine-readable `pipeline_status.v0.1` JSON (per-stage status + sha256 fingerprints of the
  target-relevant formal inputs); `gate_decision.py --pipeline-status` consumes it in preference to
  the markdown report, validating schema/target/required stages and **failing closed (BLOCK)** on a
  stale (fingerprint-mismatched), target-mismatched, malformed, or missing status. Closes the
  GAP_ANALYSIS "stale-report" risk for the structured path; the markdown fallback is preserved for
  backward compatibility. Formal stage evidence only — never source fidelity (ARCHITECTURE §11.3).
- **Expanded CI formal-layer coverage** — the `lean-build` CI job now builds **every theorem module
  and every Challenge/Solution triple for all three targets** (not just the PutCallParity triple) and
  runs `check_axioms.py` (kernel/axiom audit, all targets) and `check_equivalence.py` (all
  `NOT_REQUIRED` while every `equivalence: null`). Green CI now catches a broken triple or an axiom
  regression, not just Python-test failures. The **real Comparator** (landrun sandbox) is **not** run
  in CI — its binaries are not installed — so Comparator *acceptance* and `comparator_status`
  writeback stay local/WSL; CI proves the triples *build*, which is formal evidence only, not source
  fidelity. Reduces the GAP_ANALYSIS CI-undercoverage risk.
- **Blinding-boundary regression tests** — `scripts/test_blinding_boundary.py` (in CI) enforces the
  answer-key separation (ARCHITECTURE §9): a **static** guard asserts `run_judge.py` and
  `import_manual_judge_results.py` carry no code-level `_manifest` reference (docstrings excepted) and
  read the membership sidecar `_targets.yaml`; a **hermetic runtime/poison** test assembles fresh
  packages and proves the blinded `--dry-run` output is identical whether `_manifest.yaml` is valid,
  poisoned with contradictory labels, or removed; and a positive check confirms `score_judge.py` /
  `export_structured_judge_results.py` still read `_manifest.yaml` (un-blinding stays scoring/export
  side). Closes the "convention-enforced, not test-enforced" risk before any real judge round.

---

## Invariants preserved across all milestones

These are design constraints (see ARCHITECTURE.md), repeated here so the history reads against them:

- Formal correctness ≠ source fidelity; judge metrics ≠ theorem truth (§0).
- The GPT judge is a calibrated source-fidelity reviewer, **not** a theorem oracle.
- Live judge/API calls are **opt-in only** (`run_judge.py --execute-api`); nothing else calls a model.
- `run_judge.py` and `import_manual_judge_results.py` stay **blinded** (read `_targets.yaml`, never
  the answer key); un-blinding via `_manifest.yaml` happens only on the scoring/export side.
- `rebuild_pipeline.py` is the **formal** pipeline; the structured-judge workflow is separate.
- Judge metrics can cap to `HUMAN_REVIEW` through the gate but cannot override a formal failure.
- The Comparator compares **Challenge vs Solution**, not `.tex` source vs Lean.
- `PASS_PROVABLE_EQUIV` is guarded by an in-Lean equivalence check.
